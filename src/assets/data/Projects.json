      "title": "Person Authentication and Identification by Using Machine Learning",
      "description": "This research proposes a unique approach to biometric security by exploring the potential of using EEG signals for person authentication or identification. EEG signals of brain functioning, making them a promising modality for identification. The model is trained Using SVM, KNN, Decision Tree, RandomForest, Ensemble Learning model. • Dataset: Physionet EEG Motor Movement/Imagery Dataset",
